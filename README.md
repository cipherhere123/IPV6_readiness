# IPV6_readiness
IPV6 statistics in the Network

Scope : This script can check for the hosts which are IPV6 ready.

Use case: This script can run as a cron job to check the connectivity of a host over IPV6 and the list of devices which are not ready.

Even if the network is IPV6 ready, it is better to have the script running as sometimes there are some bugs on network devices which might drop the packets silently.

Helps in identying any network related issues like ACL modification or routing changes in the network.
